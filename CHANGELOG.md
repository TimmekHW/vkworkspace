## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Fixed middleware chain not passing kwargs to handlers with custom DI parameters (e.g. `api`, `db`), causing `missing required positional argument` errors

## [1.0.1] - 2025-02-14

### Fixed
- Fixed relative links in READMEs breaking on PyPI (now absolute GitHub URLs)
- Fixed tests workflow failing when no tests exist (exit code 5)

### Changed
- Upgraded development status from Beta to Production/Stable
- Migrated CI linter from pylint to ruff (faster, already configured)

- Improved code quality (replaced `hasattr(__call__)` with `callable()`, added `contextlib.suppress`, etc.)

### Added
